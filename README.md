# DevJournal

A simple command that makes it easier for me to maintain a basic development journal.

# Installation

To install the devjournal command:

```
go install
```

Personally, I also add the following to my .zshrc

```
alias dj="devjournal --author=\"Stephan Baker\""
```

For now this project just assumes you have the `vim` command installed.
